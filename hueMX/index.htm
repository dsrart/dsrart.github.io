    <h4>hueMX, 2024 (prototype)</h4>
    <h6>Interactive color mixer knot</h6>

    <h6>aprx. 6" x 6" x 3"</h6>
    <h6>hueMX is a prototype of a color mixing device. The hypothesis was that a prime-colored silicone cord stretched over 3 pulleys into a trefoil knot and pushed thru by a motor would create a color mixing effect. To achieve that a circuit board was running a code written in Python to allow the motor to spin in 2 directions thus mixing the closest colors in different combinations based on clockwise/ counter-clockwise movement.</h6>

    <h6>However, I came across a few problems protyping the concept.</h6>
    <h6>The design challenges of making the cord move thru were the first obstacles. I had to stagger the height of the pulleys to alleviate the friction in the knot overlaps. I was going to use 1 motor first at one of the tips but realized that I will be lobsided and would not work. So, I was going to use 3 motors. Then I experimented with a glass shot glass and rotating it from the middle of the design produces equal and smooth rotational force, so the center of the deign became the perfect spot for the motor to dive the concept. That came with further challenges. First, the DC motor used was not strong enough to pull the cord with 5 volts supplied by the circuit board. I then switched to the stepper motor, which worked better, but was too slow to prove the concept of color mixing. The third attempt was to provide the first motor with more power by connecting it to external 12 V 1 AMP power supply. Unfortunately, the power supply did not work. I also got a drill motor to try, but realized that it needed 12 V 12 Amp, but the motor controller could only handle 2 amp maximum, so I could not test it with the circuit board. So, the final attempt to prove the concept was to run the cord thru with the drill with the 3D-printed head attached with electric tape for traction. It worked the best of all other attempts but proved the concept a failure. First, the cord would not stay on the pulleys and would come of one or the other. I then tried to cut it shorter to create more tension, but it would still happen. Granted, the point of affliction was the taped connections, but even without them, it was clear that the cord would have had hard time staying on the track. Overall, it was a positive experience and though I wish it worked out, I learned from what did and didn't work, so I can use it for the next iteration of hueMX 2.0.</h6>
